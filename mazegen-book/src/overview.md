# MazeGen

MazeGen is a tool for creating Mazes.  It provides both a Rust API (viewable via
`cargo doc`) and a [Molt API](https://github.com/wduquette/molt) (documented in this book).

My goals for MazeGen are as follows:

* To provide a use case for Molt, and especially for Molt's Rust API, so that I can find
  rough spots and look for improvements.
* To build some useful bindings for other Rust crates, e.g., **image**.
  * Some of these may become crates in their own right.
* To learn more about the Rust ecosystem and the crates that are available (Molt goes out of
  its way to avoid dependencies).
* To have fun writing Rust code and playing with mazes.

Your mileage may vary.
