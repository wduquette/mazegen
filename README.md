# mazegen -- Rust Maze Generation Tools

This is meant to be a fun project, playing with the algorithms from the book
_Mazes for Programmers_ by Jamis Buck.  It is also an example of using the
[Molt](https://github.com/wduquette/molt) interpreter to wrap a Rust API as
a convenience and development aid.
